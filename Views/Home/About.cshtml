<h1>About the Project</h1>

<p>
    This project is a comprehensive AI-powered financial analysis platform designed to help users make informed stock investment decisions.
    It combines cutting-edge artificial intelligence with user preferences to provide personalized stock recommendations and portfolio tracking.
</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p>
    The platform allows users to create an account, set their investment preferences, and receive tailored stock recommendations.
    It continuously monitors the market, evaluates stocks based on multiple criteria, and advises users when to buy, hold, or sell their holdings.
</p>

<p>
    Users start by completing a detailed questionnaire that captures their risk tolerance, investment capital, and priority factors in choosing stocks.
    These factors influence how the AI weighs different data sources and scoring systems.
</p>

<h2>Core Recommendation Strategy</h2>

<p>
    The heart of the platform is a multi-AI system that evaluates stocks from three key perspectives:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Global Trend Analysis:</strong> This AI engine identifies large-scale economic and technological trends shaping the market, such as growth in AI, renewable energy, or biotech sectors.
        Stocks that align with these trends may have higher potential for growth.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Buzz and Sentiment Analysis:</strong> Using natural language processing, this AI scans news articles, social media, and financial forums to assess public and investor sentiment around companies.
        A high level of positive buzz can indicate growing interest or upcoming developments.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Financial Health Evaluation:</strong> This AI reviews key financial metrics like revenue growth, profitability, debt levels, and cash flow to assess a company’s stability and long-term potential.
        It also accounts for company stage, distinguishing between early-stage high-growth firms and established stable companies.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Each AI module independently scores stocks on a 0-100 scale for its respective area. These scores are then weighted according to the user’s preferences.
    For example, if a user values financial stability most, that score might be multiplied by 3x, while buzz and trend scores have lower multipliers.
</p>

<p>
    The combined weighted scores generate a ranked list of stock recommendations shown to the user.
    Users can refresh the list to see new recommendations or exclude stocks they dislike.
</p>

<h2>Portfolio Tracking and Recommendations</h2>

<p>
    Once users add stocks to their portfolio, the system tracks these holdings daily.
    It re-evaluates the recommendations based on updated trends, sentiment, and financial data.
    The platform then advises whether to buy more, hold, or sell, helping users stay informed and react to market changes.
    Visual profit graphs and alerts make monitoring easy and actionable.
</p>

<h2>Why This Approach?</h2>

<p>
    The stock market is influenced by a complex web of factors — economic trends, investor sentiment, and financial performance.
    This platform mimics a real-world investment team by combining specialized AI “experts” focused on different aspects.
    The user’s input personalizes the system, making the recommendations more relevant to individual goals and risk appetite.
</p>

<h2>Important Notice</h2>

<p>
    This platform is an educational and research tool, not a licensed financial advisor.
    It does not guarantee investment success or predict market movements.
    Users should always perform their own due diligence and consult professional advisors before making financial decisions.
